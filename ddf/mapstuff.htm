<h2><A NAME="top"><b>LINES and SECTORS</b></a></h2>
<p>
Line information is stored in either the lines.ddf file or the DDFLINE data lump. Sector information is stored in the sector.ddf file or in the DDFSECT data lump.
</p>
<p>
Much of the line and sector ddf code is related or identical, so their descriptions are 
combined in this one section.
</p>
<p>
These files are used to create and modify map effects, such as doors, elevators, platforms etc.
</p>
<p>
In both lines.ddf and sectors.ddf each entry consists of a unique mapnumber, enclosed in square brackets, followed by a series of commands to define the properties of the line or sector. These numbers are the ones used in your map editor, and for ease they are often grouped together according to their type.

Keep the same floor-relative height that you entered the teleporter

Keep the same centre-of-line-relative offset (between the teleporter
line and the landing site).</td></tr>

Keep the original speed that you entered the teleporter with.</td></tr>

Just a shorthand for all of the above. </td></tr>

Line-to-line teleporting (target is a linedef with same tag
as the teleport linedef).</td></tr>

Your direction after teleporting is flipped 180 degrees.</td></tr>

No fog, no noise.</td></tr>

The Linedef for a switch must be vertically reachable by the player,

in a niche (the engine has no concept of the switch image on the
texture).</td></tr>

The switch will only change the texture on the pushed linedef, and not
all the other linedefs with the same tag.</td></tr>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<tr><th>SPECIAL</th>
<th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>

<tr><td>AIRLESS</td><td>Enables airless mode in this sector. When a player is fully submerged in a sector with this special, the air meter appears in the corner of the HUD, which indicates how much air the player has left.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>PROPORTIONAL</td><td>
Use with WHOLE_REGION, and when you're vertically half-in/half-out of
the damaging sector, then damage is only 50%, and so on.</td></tr>

<tr><td>PUSH_ALL</td><td>
Makes sure <B>all</B> objects are pushed, including NOGRAVITY ones.</td></tr>

<tr><td>PUSH_CONSTANT</td><td>
The push is a constant amount.  Good for conveyor belts.  Without this flag the push is like a force and things with more MASS will move slower.</td></tr>

<tr><td>SUBMERGED_SFX</td><td>When a player is fully submerged in a sector with this special, sounds are muted and muffled to simulate being underwater.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>VACUUM_SFX</td><td>When a player is in a sector with this special, sounds are muted and muffled to simulate being in a vacuum environment.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>REVERB_SFX</td><td>When a player is in a sector with this special, sounds are distorted by the custom values we define with REVERB_TYPE, REVERB_DELAY, and REVERB_RATIO.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>SWIM</td><td>
Activates swimming mode when a player is in a sector assigned this special. This allows up and down movement in the sector, plus forward motion in the mlook directon. Jump also works differently. For this to work well, the sector should have a lower GRAVITY than normal and have similar FRICTION and DRAG values. VISCOSITY could also be used.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WHOLE_REGION</td><td>
Makes damage apply to the whole sector (and not just when you're
standing on the floor). Also affects pushing sectors: without this flag the push only happens when the object is touching the floor</td></tr>

<p>
The following are the different types of extrafloor that can be used.
</p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<tr><th>SPECIAL</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>

<tr><td>BOOMTEX</td><td>
Use BOOM's texture model (where the real sector's flats are used for
the upper part, and the control sector's flats are used for the lower
part). Normally the real flats are used for the lowest floor & highest
ceiling, and the control flats are used for the extra floor & any
ceiling underneath it.</td></tr>

<tr><td>FLOODER</td><td>
Such an extrafloor will "flood" all vertical regions below it with
the same sector properties.  Useful for liquids that raise/lower past
other extra floors.</td></tr>

<tr><td>LIQUID</td><td>
Defines a liquid extrafloor, which is not solid and can be passed
through (by players, monsters, missiles and other objects).  Normally
it is thin (just a surface, like the surface of water or lava), but
can be used with the THICK keyword too.</td></tr>

<tr><td>SEE_THROUGH</td><td>
Use this to make a translucent extrafloor (even one that is totally
invisible). </td></tr>

<tr><td>SHOOT_THROUGH</td><td>
Specifies that bullets can pass through this extrafloor. (Always true
for when LIQUID is used).
</td></tr>

<tr><td>SIDE_UPPER<br>SIDE_LOWER</td><td>
Extrafloors usually take the side texture from the tagged line of the
dummy sector. Instead, this makes it use the upper/lower texture from
the line where the extrafloor appears. Useful if the textures on the
extrafloor's side need to change often.</td></tr>

<tr><td>THICK</td><td>
Defines a thick solid extrafloor, which has a top, bottom and sides.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>THIN</td><td>
Defines a thin solid extrafloor - it is just a surface (a single
plane, with no sides).  This is the default.</td></tr>

<tr><td>WATER</td><td>
Objects tagged WATERWALKER cannot penetrate extrafloors tagged as
WATER. (Can be used to keep creatures like fish under
water).</td></tr>
