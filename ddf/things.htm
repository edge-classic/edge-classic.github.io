<h2><A NAME="top"><b>THINGS</b></a></h2>
<p>
Stored in the things.ddf file or in the DDFTHING data lump.
</p>
<p>
Things.ddf allows you to define and modify all the creatures and objects in EDGE. Each entry consists of a unique name and mapnumber, enclosed in square brackets, followed by a series of commands that specify the characteristics of the object or monster. Both the name portion and the mapnumber should be unique and are included together in the square brackets at the beginning of the commands for that thing. 
</p>
<p>
The map number is referred to from the map in the wadfile, or from an rts script, whilst the name will be referred to in other ddf files where necessary E.g. spawner attacks.
<br>
&nbsp
</p>
<p>
<b><FONT SIZE=+1>COMMANDS</font></b>
</p>
<p>

The commands that can be used to specify properties of a thing are as follows:

<BR>There are 26 possible classes, A thru Z.
Three are reserved: `M' is the default for missile
attacks, `B' is the default ATTACK_CLASS for
bullet/shot attacks, and `C' is the default for
close-combat attacks.
<br>Examples:
<br>ARMOUR_CLASS=B; //only protects against bullets 
<BR>or 
<BR>ARMOUR_CLASS=CV; //protects against close attacks and attacks of a custom Attack_class V
<br>Note that ARMOUR_CLASS overrides the immunity/resistance classes.
</td></tr>

<FONT SIZE=+1><b>STATES</b></FONT>
</p>
<p>
Each named STATES entry defines an animation sequence to play when an attack is in progress, as well as calling the actions required at the appropriate frames in the animation. These consist of a series of states, which are individual frames of the animation. A state is defined like this:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Sprite:Frame:Tics:Bright:Action</code>
<br>
as follows:
</p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>

<tr><td>Sprite</td><td>
The four letter name of the sprite to use.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Frame</td><td>
The frame reference, A-Z, '[', '\', ']' If you need more than this,
use another sprite.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Tics</td><td>
Number of tics to spend on this frame. -1 means the frame should last
forever.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Bright</td><td>
Can be 'BRIGHT', 'NORMAL' or 'LIT00-99'. Bright frames are always drawn full
brightness.
<br>LIT00-LIT99: This allows fine-grained control of dynamic lights. LIT00 is the same as 'NORMAL', LIT99 is the same as 'BRIGHT'.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>Action</td><td>
Action to be carried out. <a href="#actions">Actions</a> are listed below.</td></tr>

<p>


Each frame ends with either a semicolon <b>;</b> if it is the last frame in the animation or a comma <b>,</b> if it is not. 
<br>
In addition, any line may include a <tt>#Command</tt> at the end. This will either be <tt>#STATENAME</tt> which causes a jump to the first frame in the animation of the named state. <tt>#STATENAME:FRAME</tt> causing a jump to the specified frame number in the animation of the named state. OR <tt>#REMOVE</tt> to remove the animation shown from the HUD.

this will make sure the whole animation is played out and won't be interrupted by another
 shot which would normally make us re-start the pain animation again.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>SET_SCALE</td><td>
Used like SET_SCALE(0.5). Stretches or shrinks the total size (width and height) of sprite graphics. 1 is normal perspective, 0.5 will make graphics half normal

Creates a smoke trail behind the object.</td></tr>

<tr><td>SPARE_ATTACK</td><td>
Starts the spare attack.</td></tr>

<tr><td>TOUCHY_REARM</td><td>
Rearms a touchy object, allowing it to react to future collisions.
When a touchy object is touched, it enters its TOUCH states and is
automatically disarmed, preventing an action sequence from being
interrupted by further collisions. </td></tr>
