  EDGE-Classic v1.33 released</b></span><br>
        <br>
  
        New minor release of EDGE-Classic. Fixes and updates include:<br><br>
  
- Fixed 1.32 secret sector fix not being preserved in save games; i.e. the same secret would increment the
secret counter when re-loading the game<br>
- Fixed jitter in Evil Eye and other animations<br>
- Fixed sprite frame overrides in DDFIMAGE not applying if they were Doom formatted images<br>
- Fixed SDL sound device frequency being allowed to be set far above intended values if OS doesn't report the ability
to use 48kHz sample rate<br>
- Fixed Boom tagged line effects also applying the effect to the control linedef (when a tag was present)<br>
- Fixed Boom vector linedef scroll directions for angles other than 0/45/90<br>
- Fixed Boom displacement scrollers not returning back to their exact original position<br>
- Fixed Boom scrollers tied to permanently moving sectors (i.e., Door Open and Stay Open) being ineffective<br>
- Fixed inanimate objects adhering to monster dropoff limits when being carried over a drop<br>
- Fixed overzealous oofing when falling or bumping into a ceiling<br>
- Doom2 Map05 bug fixed properly this time ;)<br>
- Fixed some new DDFSTYLE additions (entry and cursor alignment, etc) not working as intended with the Episode Select menu<br>
- Clip size was not being updated with RTS ReplaceWeapon and DDF weapon BECOME()<br>
- Fixed items with the HOVER flag still hovering when time is stopped<br>
- Fixed HUD and other non-game world animations unintentionally freezing during time stop<br>
- Fixed ENDOOM bytes that happen to match the value of a newline character being intepreted as newline characters<br>
<br>
<br>
- Improved model and unit rendering to thrash the GL state a bit less<br>

- DDFSTYLE text styles can now have their own individual X_OFFSET and Y_OFFSET values,<br>
  giving more flexibility for menu item placement i.e. TITLE.Y_OFFSET or TEXT.Y_OFFSET etc<br>
  
- Changed how LOSE_BENEFIT HEALTH is handled in RTS. Now it will simply subtract from current health and not<br>
  behave like DAMAGE_PLAYER(which reduces armour, causes pain states, respects immunity/resistence/invulnerable/immortal etc).<br>

- "Crosshair Size" option in Video Options menu will now apply to both the standard crosshair and custom weapon crosshair states<br>
  (previously this only affected standard crosshairs)<br>
  
- Monsters resurrected by Archviles will no longer count as kills.<br>

- Replaced WebSID SID backend with cRSID for easier compilation and better performance<br>

- Things no longer constantly trigger splashes when walking on a flat defined as LIQUID (and having an IMPACT_OBJECT defined). <br>
  They will only cause a splash when they step down onto the flat.<br>

- Unsupported BEX INCLUDE directive for Dehacked downgraded from a program-ending error to a warning with an appropriate console/log message.<br>

- Migrated from libXMP to Mod4Play (custom library) for portability/performance<br>
  - Only the "Big 4" tracker formats are supported now (IT/S3M/XM/MOD)<br>

- Upgraded to AJBSP 1.04<br>

- Added support for ZGL3 compressed lumps to AJBSP and EDGE-Classic's node loading routines to conserve cache folder space. ZGL3 will now<br>
  be the default node format.<br>

- Replaced Gamma options with Sector Brightness for better results without affecting other windows on the same display<br>
<br>
<br>
- Added support for MDL (Quake 1) model format<br>

- Added support for KVX and KV6 voxel model formats<br>

- Ported MD3 model support from EDGE 1.32 codebase<br>

- DDFTHING:<br>
  - New command: FALLPAIN_SOUND, which is the sfx to be played when the player is hurt from a big fall<br>
  - New command: MODEL_ROTATE = (integer), which for MDL/MD2/MD3/Voxels will rotate all vertices' x/y coordinates by the<br>
    given (positive or negative) number of degrees. Used to correct imported models whose rotations are wrong. Default is 0.<br>

- DDFIMAGE:<br>
  - New command: ROTATE_HUE = (integer), will rotate the hue of the given image while keeping other values the same. Valid range is -1800<br>
    to 1800, with a default of 0.<br>

- COAL:<br>
  - C+- Interop: Can now retrieve and set individual vector elements with the VM_GetVectorX/Y/Z and VM_SetVectorX/Y/Z functions<br>
  - COALHUDS: Can now access individual vector elements with .x, .y, or .z<br>

- Transition from GWA to XWA cache file format<br>
  - Improved organization of AJBSP-generated XGL/ZGL lumps<br>
  - Legacy GWA files will be purged from cache directory on startup<br>

        <br>
  
      New minor release of EDGE-Classic. Fixes and updates include:<br><br>

- Fixed player.use_inventory() consuming item without running the associated script if the script was already running.<br>
- Fixed "Read This!" main menu item missing when Doom is current IWAD.<br>
- Changed hardcoded finish/par time widths to prevent custom fonts from being clipped at 4:3 resolutions<br>
- COALHUDS: new commands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--hud.rts_isactive(tag): Returns 1 if the script "tag" is currently enabled, 0 if disabled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--hud.rts_enable(name): Will execute RTS script with matching tag, if one exists. This replaces previous COAL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command "<b>player.rts_enable_tagged(name)</b>" which should be considered deprecated.<br>
- DDFSTYLE: new text style - SELECTED<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Uses all parameters that regular style font entries use (SELECTED.FONT, SELECTED.SCALE, etc)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Will only apply to the currently selected/highlighted menu item<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--If not defined, will fall back to previous behavior for backwards compatibility<br>
- DDFSTYLE: new command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- CURSOR.FORCE_OFFSETS = TRUE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When set to true, will honor cursor image's offsets even if they cause misalignment with
menu entries. Default value is false. <br>
- DDFSTYLE: Menu items that are images instead of fonts will now also apply the font colormap setting in that menu's
style entry (if defined)<br>
