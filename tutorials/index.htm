 Mapping tutorial ONE: <b>How to make a 3d floor.</b>

<IMG SRC="3dfloor.jpg" HEIGHT="300" BORDER=0 style="margin:0px 20px" ALT="">
<BR><BR>
	<B>A)</B> Make a dummy sector. <SMALL><I>(A dummy sector is just a little sector not connected to anything else in case you were wondering)</I></SMALL>. 
	<br>This dummy sector will have most of the properties of the 3D floor. It's floor and ceiling textures control those on the extrafloor. The lighting level (and blink effects) control those underneath the extrafloor.
	<br>Give it a distance between floor and ceiling of the thickness you want the 3d floor to be: by this I mean that the floor height of the dummy sector will be the bottom of the extrafloor, and the ceiling height will be the top. 
	<br>One of the lines of this dummy sector should be <b>400</b> which corresponds to our <CODE><B>EDGE Thick Extrafloor (dummy texture)</B></CODE>. Give this line a tag number(for example 106).The texture on the tagged line in the dummy sector will appear on the side of the extrafloor.
	
	<BR><BR>

	<B>B)</B> Now place a sector where you want it to appear in the map and tag this sector to the line defined earlier(106)

 Mapping tutorial TWO: <b>How to make swimmable water.</b>
<br>
<IMG SRC="water1.jpg" HEIGHT="300" BORDER=0 ALT=""><IMG SRC="water2.jpg" HEIGHT="300" ALT="">
<BR><BR>
	<B>A)</B> Make a dummy sector. <SMALL><I>(A dummy sector is just a little sector not connected to anything else in case you were wondering)</I></SMALL>. 
	<br>This dummy sector will have a sector type of <b>4466</b> which corresponds to our <CODE><B>EDGE Blue Hue (SWIMMABLE WATER)</B></CODE>.
	<br>The lighting level (and blink effects) control those we'll see when we're underneath the water.
	<br>One of the lines of this dummy sector should be of type <b>407</b> which corresponds to our <CODE><B>EDGE Liquid Extrafloor (80% Translucent)</B></CODE>. Give this line a tag number(for example 108).
	<br>Now, the floor height of the dummy sector will be the water level(i.e. the top of the water). Lets make it -8. This will make any sector tagged to 108 (the line we defined earlier) with a floor height BELOW -8 be a pool of water. The ceiling height can be anything higher than the floor height, though a good habit is to just set floor and ceiling to be the same height to avoid confusion.

	<BR><BR>

	<B>B)</B> Now place a sector where you want the water pool to appear in the map and tag this sector to the line defined earlier(108). This new sector should have a floor height LESS than what you have defined in the dummy sector, otherwise the "hole" won't reach the underlying water level.  Let's make it -104 deep.

 Mapping tutorial THREE: <b>How to make a horizontal sliding door.</b>

<IMG SRC="slidingdoor.jpg" HEIGHT="300" BORDER=0 style="margin:0px 20px" ALT="">
<BR><BR>

	<B>A)</B> Place a two-sided linedef on the map. It should be placed inside a sector of appropriate height(say 128 high) so that the texture tiles well. Give it a main(mid) texture which looks good for this kind of effect(say MIDBRN1).
	
	<BR><BR>

	<B>B)</B> Give this line a type of <b>442</b>, which corresponds to our <CODE><B>EDGE Sliding door (LEFT), DR + MONSTERS</B></CODE>

	<br><br>Now when we "use" this line the door will open by sliding off to one side!

	<br><br><SMALL><I>Note that in the example wad I've left a bit of a gap between the sliding door and the wall, so you can see better that it's a single unconnected line.</I></SMALL>

 Mapping tutorial FOUR: <b>How to make a ladder.</b>
<br>
<IMG SRC="ladders.jpg" HEIGHT="300" BORDER=0 style="margin:0px 20px" ALT="">
<BR><BR>

	<B>A)</B> Make a platform in your map of a height of around 120. Give one of the lines an appropriate texture for a ladder.
	
	<BR><BR>

	<B>B)</B> Place a two-sided linedef on the map, just in front of the line with the ladder texture. Don't give it any textures so it stays invisible to the player. Make sure the line is two-sided and that it's not set to impassable or block player in your editor.

	<BR>Give this line a type of <b>472</b>, which corresponds to our <CODE><B>EDGE Ladder, 120 units high</B></CODE>

	<BR><BR>Now when we press "UP" standing on top of this line we will start to climb.

 Mapping tutorial FIVE: <b>How to make a breakable window.</b>
<br>
<IMG SRC="breakingglass.jpg" HEIGHT="300" BORDER=0 style="margin:0px 20px" ALT="">
<BR><BR>

	<B>A)</B> Place a two-sided linedef on the map. It should be placed inside a sector of appropriate height(say 128 high) so that the texture tiles well. Give it a main(mid) texture which looks good for this kind of effect(say SHAWN2). It doesn't matter if it's not set to impassable or block player in your editor: EC will take care of that for you.
	The translucency of the texture will be set to 60% automatically too.
	<BR><BR>

	<B>B)</B> Give this line a type of <b>830</b>, which corresponds to our <CODE><B>Breakable Glass: monster can see, can break</B></CODE> 

	<BR><BR>Now when we shoot the line: 
	<br>-the texture will be removed
	<br>-the line will no longer be blocking

 Mapping tutorial SIX: <b>How to make breakable vent/wall.</b>
<br>
<IMG SRC="breakablewall1.jpg" HEIGHT="300" BORDER=0 ALT=""><IMG SRC="breakablewall2.jpg" HEIGHT="300" ALT="">
<BR><BR>

	<br>Similar to breakable glass but with a few important differences:
	<br>Firstly, we will replace the texture with another one instead of just removing it, translucency of the texture will not be set to 60% and finally we do not spawn glass debris.
	<br><br>
	<B>A)</B> Place a two-sided linedef on the map. Since we're going with a vent effect, it should be placed inside a sector of appropriate height(say 64 high) so that ideally the texture does not tile. Give it a main(mid) texture which looks good for this kind of effect(the demo wad includes a custom vent texture <CODE><B>"VENT01OK"</B></CODE>). It doesn't matter if the line is set to impassable or block player in your editor: EC will take care of that for you.

	<BR><BR>

	<B>B)</B> Give this line a type of <b>837</b>, which corresponds to our <CODE><B>Breakable Wall: midtex to front lower.</B></CODE>
	<br> Set the lower front side texture to what you want displayed when this line is shot (the demo wad includes a custom vent texture <CODE><B>"VENT01KO"</B></CODE>).

	<BR><BR>Now when we shoot the line: 
	<br>-the middle texture will be swapped for the lower texture.
	<br>-if the line is 2-sided, it will no longer be blocking.
